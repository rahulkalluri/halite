# Halite AI Challenge
Halite is a programming game where players build smart bots that battle head-to-head with the goal of taking over the largest share of a virtual grid. Bots use their strength to gain territory, and their territory to gain strengthâ€”outmaneuvering opponents based on the relative sophistication of their code.
